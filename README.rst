This project is a re-write of the C++ bindings for the `PCRE`_ (Perl-Compatible
Regular Expressions).  It aims to bring a cleaner, simpler interface to the
PCRE library.

.. warning::

   This library is in the experimental stage.  Do not use (yet) in production
   code.  In particular, interfaces are likely to change and not all possible
   error handling is included.

You don't need my consent or anything to use the software, but it would be nice
